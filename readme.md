    - **If No**:
      - Hash the password using libraries like `bcrypt.js` or `argon2.js`.
      - Create a new user and store their `name`, `email`, and hashed `password` in the database.

  ### For Login

  - Extracting User Data from the Request Body:

    ```javascript
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    ```

  - Validating User Credentials:
    - **If User Exists and Password Matches**:
      - Generate a token and send it back as cookies.
    - **If Not**: Return a message prompting the user to sign up first.

  ### Creating Endpoint to Write Data into the Database

  - Implement an API route to handle requests for adding new product data into the database.

    ```javascript
    app.post("/add-product", (req, res) => {
      const { name, description, price, imageUrl } = req.body;
      // Logic to store the product in the database
    });
    ```

  ### Integrating Cloudinary and Multer

## Project Milestone 11

- **Product Schema and Endpoints**

  - Define a schema for products, including necessary fields such as `title`, `description`, `rating`, `discountedPrice`, `originalPrice`, `quantity`, `category`, and `images`.

  ### Creating Endpoint to Display All Products

  - Created a new API endpoint to retrieve and display all the products from the database.

    ```javascript
    // product.router.js
    router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const products = await ProductModel.find({});
        res.status(200).send({
          success: true,
          message: "Products retrieved successfully",
          data: products,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send({
          success: false,
          message: "Error retrieving products",
          error: error.message,
        });
      }
    });
    ```

  ### Integrating the New Route

  - Added the `/get-products` route in `product.router.js` to handle the retrieval of all product data. This route queries the database and returns a list of products.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const router = express.Router();
    const ProductModel = require("./models/ProductModel");

    // Endpoint to fetch all products
    router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
      // Logic to fetch products
    });

    module.exports = router;
    ```

  ### Integration with Server

  - Ensure the `product.router.js` file is properly imported and used in the main server file:

    ```javascript
    const productRoutes = require("./routes/product.router");
    app.use("/api/products", productRoutes);
    ```
